# Discord Bot Command Handler

This is a small project I made for fun to learn about the Discord api and the DiscordJS wrapper.

At first this was only supposed to be a simple command handler I made because a friend of mine couldn't get to create one, but it might get even better in the future, and maybe be a full multi-tooling bot :D
